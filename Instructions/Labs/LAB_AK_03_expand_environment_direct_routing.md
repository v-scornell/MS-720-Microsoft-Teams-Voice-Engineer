## Exercise 2: Configure direct routing settings

### Exercise Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**:  120 minutes

In this exercise, you will create a direct route routing policy, PSTN Usage policy, and voice route to enable Megan Bowen to perform voice calls over the SBC. Megan resides in a location where the telephone number assigned to her has a long-standing contract and requires her to continue to use the telephone service provider telephone number rather than moving to a calling plan from Microsoft. Long term the plan is to move the telephone number over to a calling plan, however, currently this is cost prohibitive. 

### Task 1 - Create a voice routing policy with one PSTN usage

In the following task you will create your first voice routing policy and PSTN usage so you can later assign this policy to your users.

1. You are still on MS720-CLIENT01 where you are still signed in as “Admin”.

2. Select the Windows symbol in the task bar, type **PowerShell** and open a regular PowerShell window.

3. In Windows PowerShell, enter the following cmdlet to connect to Teams in your tenant:

    ```powershell
    Connect-MicrosoftTeams

    ```

4. In the prompt sign in as **Katie Jordan** with the credentials provided to you.

5. In Windows Powershell, enter the following and then press **Enter**. By running the command you will see that the existing PSTN usages in place. You can see what is in place and what usage plans are being assigned to the identity. 

    ```powershell
    Get-CsOnlinePstnUsage

    ```

6. Review the output of the command.

If you have several usages defined, the names of the usages might truncate. Use the command, (Get-CSOnlinePSTNUsage).Usage, to display a list of the defined PSTN usages. An online PSTN usage links an online voice policy to a route. The output will show if there is an identity that can be used or possibly reused, or also excluded from being used. For example there may be a PSTN usage called Seattle, that can cover all of the Pacific North West of the United States. The overall goal is to keep your PSTN Usage rules to a minimum and keep them simple as it will reduce the overall administration effort later. We want to validate that the information we have in the tenant is relevant and also ensure we do not duplicate any existing PSTN usages. 

7. Run the Set-CSOnlinePSTNUsage cmdlet is used to add or remove phone usages to or from the usage list. This list is global so it can be used by policies and routes throughout the tenant:

    ```powershell
    Set-CsOnlinePstnUsage -Identity Global -Usage @{Add="US and Canada"}

    ```

8. Run the New-CSOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy to create a new online voice routing policy. Online voice routing policies are used in Microsoft Phone System Direct Routing scenarios. Assigning your Teams users an online voice routing policy enables those users to receive and to place phone calls to the public switched telephone network by using your on-premises SIP trunks:

    ```powershell
    New-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy "North America" -OnlinePstnUsages "US and Canada"

    ```

9. Run the New-CsOnlineVoiceRoute command - Creates a new online voice route. Online voice routes contain instructions that tell Microsoft Teams how to route calls from Office 365 users to phone numbers on the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or a private branch exchange (PBX):

    ```powershell
    New-CsOnlineVoiceRoute -Identity "10 Digit Dialing" -NumberPattern "^\+1(\d{10})$" -OnlinePstnGatewayList sbc01.lab<customlabnumber>.o365ready.com -OnlinePstnUsages "US and Canada"

    ```

10. Run the Get-CSOnlineVoiceRoute command, this command returns information about the online voice routes configured for use in your tenant. Online voice routes contain instructions that tell Microsoft Teams how to route calls from Office 365 users to phone numbers on the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or a private branch exchange (PBX):

    ```powershell
    Get-CsOnlineVoiceRoute

    ```

11. Review the output of the command and verify that your new voice route has been added.

12. Leave the PowerShell window open for the next task.

You have successfully created a voice routing policy with a PSTN Usage.

### Task 2 - Create a new voice routing policy named North America and assign it to Megan Bowen

In the following task you will create another voice routing policy with the PSTN usage you created in an earlier task and assign this policy to your users.

1. You are still on MS720-CLIENT01 where you are still signed in as “Admin”, and you have an open **Teams PowerShell** session signed in as **Katie Jordan**.

2. Run the Grant-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy, the command assigns a per-user online voice routing policy to one or more users. Online voice routing policies manage online PSTN usages for Phone System users:

    ```powershell
    Grant-CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy -Identity MeganB@lab<customlabnumber>.o365ready.com -PolicyName "North America"

    ```

If you receive an error stating that the **Policy "North America" is not a user policy. You can assign only a user policy to a specific user**., wait 2-3 minutes and then retry the command. You may need to retry the command several times before it is successful and it may take up to 15 minutes before it becomes available. If the policy is still not updated in the service, you continue to the next lab and return later.

3. Run the Get-CsOnlineUser command, the command returns information about users who have accounts homed on Microsoft Teams:

    ```powershell
    Get-CsOnlineUser MeganB | select OnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy

    ```

4. Review the output of the command. If the policy is empty, try the command again.

5. Leave the PowerShell window open for the next task.

You have successfully used PowerShell to assign your voice routing policy to your users.

### Task 3 - Enable users for Direct Routing, voice, and voicemail

In the following task you will enable the end user for voice services through the direct route, assign the telephone number, and enable the user for dial pad service.

1. You are still on MS720-CLIENT01 where you are still signed in as “Admin” and you have an open **Teams PowerShell** session signed in as **Katie Jordan**.

2. Run the Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment command, the command assigns a phone number to a user or resource account. When you assign a phone number the EnterpriseVoiceEnabled flag is automatically set to True.:

    ```powershell
    Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment -Identity MeganB@lab<customlabnumer>.o365ready.com -PhoneNumber "+14255551234" -PhoneNumberType DirectRouting

    ```

3. The cmdlet does not provide any output. When you are back on the command prompt, leave the window open for the next task.
